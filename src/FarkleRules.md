The goal is to reach **10,000 points**. You play with 6 dice.

### Scoring

- **Single 1:** 100 points
- **Single 5:** 50 points
- **Three 1s:** 1,000 points
- **Three Xs:** X \* 100 (e.g., three 2s = 200)
- **Doubling:** 4-of-a-kind doubles the 3-kind score. 5-of-a-kind doubles again. 6-of-a-kind doubles again.

### How to Play

1. Roll the dice. Tap dice to **Keep** them.
2. **Triples:** Selecting one die of a triple will auto-select the others.
3. You can only keep scoring dice!
4. **Bank** points to end turn, or **Roll Remaining** to risk it for more.

6. **Hot Hand:** If you use all 6 dice, you MUST **Roll All 6** again to continue accumulating!
